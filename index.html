      <h3>Introduction to Pottery Techniques and Tools</h3>
      <p>The first step in a pottery school is usually an introduction to pottery techniques and tools. This may include demonstrations on how to properly center clay on the wheel, how to throw basic shapes, and how to use various pottery tools like ribs, sponges, and trimming tools. Students will also learn about different types of clay and glazes, and the basic principles of firing and kiln operation.

      <h3>Hands-On Practice and Skill-Building</h3>
      <p>After the introductory phase, students will have the opportunity to practice and build their skills through hands-on projects. This may include making functional pottery items such as cups, bowls, and plates, or more decorative pieces such as vases, sculptures, and wall hangings. During this phase, students will work on refining their techniques, experimenting with different clay bodies and glazes, and exploring their own creative ideas.</p>

      <h3>Exhibition and Critique</h3>
      <p>The final step in a pottery school is often an exhibition and critique. Students will have the opportunity to showcase their work and receive feedback from their instructor and classmates. This is a valuable learning opportunity, as it allows students to reflect on their progress, receive constructive criticism, and gain insight into their strengths and areas for improvement. Additionally, the exhibition serves as a celebration of the students' hard work and achievements, and can be a great way to inspire others to try pottery themselves.</p>
